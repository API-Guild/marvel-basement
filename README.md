### Usage
User arives on page and has the option to search for a character in the search bar at the top of the page or choose from a list of popular characters at the bottom of the page. If the user choses search, they can type in the name of a character, click the search icon, and the page will populate with the character's name, image, number of comic/series/stories/events they appear in. A gif relevant to the character, and a brief description is also displayed. The same will occur in Popular Characters but from a predetermined list of characters. Once searched the character will appear in the favorites dropdown menu to potentially be selected again. On smaller devices, Popular Characters becomes a side bar. Searches are stored locally for fast retrieval in the future.
